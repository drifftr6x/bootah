Bootah — Next-Gen Lightweight PXE + Imaging Platform
1. Concept & Positioning

Bootah = a portable, modern, cross-platform PXE server + OS imaging tool designed for IT admins, MSPs, and system builders.

Target Users: Sysadmins, IT consultants, labs, classrooms, retail chains, manufacturing plants.

Why it wins:

Portable (single binary or container).

Easy (GUI + WebUI).

Modern (cloud integration, security, APIs).

Lightweight (no SCCM/MDT overhead).

Tagline idea:

“Boot smarter. Deploy faster.”

2. Core Feature Set
MVP (Bootah Community)

PXE server supporting BIOS & UEFI (32/64).

Serve WinPE, Linux, custom ISOs.

Simple web dashboard to add/remove OS images.

Capture → Deploy workflow (WIM + FFU).

Auto-detect drivers for PXE boot.

Logs & session viewer.

Pro (Bootah Enterprise)

Multicast deployments.

Role-based PXE menus (per department/MAC address).

Secure Boot + TLS delivery.

Driver & Windows Update injection.

Cloud storage sync (Azure, AWS, GDrive).

REST API + CLI for orchestration.

Post-deployment scripting (PowerShell, Ansible hooks).

Audit logs (per-device deployment history).

Cross-platform image support (Windows, Linux, macOS partitions).

3. Architecture & Tech Stack

Core Services:

PXE/TFTP/HTTP/DHCP Proxy in Go (fast, portable).

WinPE/Linux boot support via iPXE.

Image Handling:

Windows DISM & wimlib for WIM/FFU.

Partclone/Clonezilla libs for Linux/macOS imaging.

Web Dashboard:

Frontend: React + Tailwind.

Backend: Go (Gin/Fiber) or Rust (Actix).

Auth: JWT + Role-based Access.

Cloud Integration:

S3 SDK (AWS/GCP/Azure).

rclone integration for other storage.

Packaging:

Standalone EXE for Windows.

Docker container for Linux/cloud.

Optional:

Local DB: SQLite/Postgres for deployment history.

Remote Agent for scaling multiple Bootah nodes.

5. Brand / Identity

Name: Bootah (playful, memorable, IT sysadmin-friendly).

Logo idea: A rocket-shaped bootloader icon 🚀 with pixel-style “B” inside.

Colors: Dark cyber background (#081c29 👈 matches your style preference) with bright accents (cyan/green).

Tone: Lightweight, hacker/sysadmin vibe but polished enough for enterprise.
