# GRUB2 UEFI Bootloader Stub
# This is a placeholder for grubx64.efi (UEFI boot loader)
#
# In production:
# 1. For UEFI Secure Boot, download signed version from your distro
# 2. For standard UEFI, use any recent GRUB2:
#    - Build from source: https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
#    - Or download pre-built from your Linux distro
#
# 3. For Secure Boot signing:
#    sbsign --key db.key --cert db.crt grubx64.efi --output grubx64.efi.signed
#
# Boot Mode: UEFI or UEFI Secure Boot
